First-round test for prospective IoT Site Reliability Engineers at OptiRTC

## Welcome

This repository is the starting point for the new OptiRTC IoT Site Reliability Engineer take-home test. It includes a brief specifications document describing the application you should create to include in your OptiRTC job application. Please follow the Getting Started guide below to submit your application to the OptiRTC development team.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local system.
2. Create your tests in accordance with the [Functional Specification](FunctionalSpec.md)
3. Attach a zip file of your complete repository along with your job application
   - Exclude items from zip that are in `.gitignore` such as `node_modules` which we can install with `npm install`

## How you will be evaluated

We are looking for concise and readable code that meets the component specifications. Where the component specifications are ambiguous or lacking, we are looking to see you make a decision that allows you to move forward without compromising the basic functionality of the application. We are expecting this task to take you 1-3 hours; please do not spend more than 5 hours on this task.
